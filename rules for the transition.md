It is important to

state p can move to state q as follows

x1 can always change from 0 to 1
y1 can always change from 0 to 1
x1 cannot change from 1 to 0
y1 cannot change from 1 to 0
x2 cannot change from 1 to 0
y2 cannot change from 1 to 0

s1 can always go from 0 to 1
s2 can always go from 0 to 1
if s1 goes from 1 to 0, then a must also become 1
if s2 goes from 1 to 0, then b must also become 1

if s1 goes from 1 to 2, then x1, y1,y2 must also become 1
if s2 goes from 1 to 2, then y1, x1, x2 must also become 1

if s1 goes from 2 to 0, then b must become 1
if s2 goes from 2 to 0, then a must become 1

if s1 goes from 2 to 3, then x1, x2, y1, y2 must also become 1
if s2 goes from 2 to 3, then x1, x2, y1, y2 must also become 1


S1 -> S2 (x1,y1,y2)
